Assignment 2 is converted to be Final Assignment

In this assignment, you have a sales dataset that contains data from different countries and cities. 
Using python, you are required to explore the data, find the size of the data, visualize the different 
columns and find the relation between these columns such as cost, profit and revenue. However, 
before exploring these relations you need to make sure the dataset is free of the following:
• Inconsistent column names
• Missing data
• Outliers
• Duplicate rows (full duplication)
• Untidy
• Need to process columns
• Column types can signal unexpected data value

You are required to explain what you found and how you solved it. Visualize the data before and 
after the cleaning process.
